# jpana

There are many "flashcard" web applications for memorizing Hirigana (and eventually Katakana). This one is mine.

## Motivation

This application was inspired by Phil Gyford's [Hirigana and Katakana quiz](https://www.gyford.com/japanese/) which is very good. I wanted something like that but with a few differences:

* I did not want a progress or score counter
* I wanted a built-in lookup table, or chart, of characters
* I wanted a skip this character button
* I wanted an application that could work offline

So, that's what `jpana` does.

## Why is it called "jpana" ?

Mostly because I didn't spend much time thinking about a name. Both hirigana and katakana end in "ana" and "jp" is the abbreviation for Japan, so "jp" + "ana".
