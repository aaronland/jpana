# jpana

There are many "flashcard" web applications for memorizing Hirigana (and eventually Katakana). This one is mine.

## Motivation


## Why is it called "jpana" ?

Mostly because I didn't spend much time thinking about a name. Both hirigana and katakana end in "ana" and "jp" is the abbreviation for Japan, so "jp" + "ana".
